Building this using this [nice guide by Sam Csik](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)

# git/github
Some issues getting up and running, largely seemed to be due to connecting the local repository to the correct remote one (follow what github says when you first have the remote repository created)

Followed this [installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/#install) first just to double-check everything was working. 

I found [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) useful

# customizing
Here are [quarto templates](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates), adjusted in the "about" section of the index.qmd file

And here are some helpful [markdown basics](<https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>)

[Themes](https://bootswatch.com/) from bootswatch to mess with

# css customizations
I next worked through the [customizing quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide) slides
